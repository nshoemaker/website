website

norashoemaker.com

This is just a backup of my old personal website. 

Originally I planned on making a website from scratch.

MY first try looked like this: http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/nshoemak/

My second try used [fullpage.js](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/) and this repo remains in this format. Unfortunately, this version of my website was not mobile friendly because fullpage.js does not support pinch to zoom on mobile. This is a known [issue] (https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/issues/125), and it does not look like it will be fixed soon. My design was responsive, but I would rather give users the option of zooming in, if they desire, rather than dictating a fixed size.

The most recent version of my website can be found [here] (https://github.com/nshoemaker/startbootstrap-freelancer). I decided to fork a pre-existing portfolio template as this ensured my website would be mobile friendly. For now, all further website updates will be done in that fork, rather than this repository.
